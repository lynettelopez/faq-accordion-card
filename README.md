# FAQ Accordion Card Component

## The Challenge

As part of a series of challenges on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), I had to build an FAQ accordion card component and get it looking as close to the mock-up design as possible.

## Requirements

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on the device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## Design
